# Cryptography-Term-Project
Implementation of the learned concepts in cryptography course on blockchain technology

## Project Overview

Implemented an algorithm for first signing any given message, then using this digital signature, generated a block of random transaction and Proof-of-Work for the block. Then integrated elliptic curve digital signature algorithm and created a blockchain by linking blocks using Proof-of-Work.
